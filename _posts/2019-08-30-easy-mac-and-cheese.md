## 3+ Ingredient Mac N Cheese 

Inspired by [this recipe by Alvin Zhou on Tasty,] (https://tasty.co/recipe/3-ingredient-mac-cheese) you can make this recipe 
simply or jazz it up easily by throwing some extra cheese and breadcrumbs on top and throwing it in the oven to get extra 
gooey and delicious!

### Ingredients
*1 cup Milk
*1 cup Noodles (macaroni, shells, rotini, etc.)
*Shredded Cheese (cheddar, mozzerela, monterey, parmesan, etc.) 
*(Optional) Crackers (crumble into breadcrumbs), 
*(Optional) Veggies (broccoli, sweet potatoes, etc.)
*(Optional) Protein (cooked chicken, bacon, etc.)

### Recipe 
1. Bring 1/2 milk and 1/2 water to a boil. 
2. Add noodles. They should be submersed in the boiling milk and water.
3. Stir occasionally, remove milk chunks on top as you go. Continue until noodles cooked (app. 10 min) and most of milk absorbed. 
4. Add cheese-- the more the merrier! A variety of cheeses (sharp cheddar, white cheddar, mozzerela) will give the dish a 
better taste.
5. Add salt and pepper to your liking. (I like to use garlic salt and pepper.)
6. (Optional) Add any other protein or veggie fix-ins you enjoy. 
7. (Optional) Move the mac' into an oven-safe pot. Add shredded cheese on top. Crumble crackers on top. 
8. Pop this deliciousness in the over for 5-8 minutes until golden brown on top.

That's it -- Enjoy!
