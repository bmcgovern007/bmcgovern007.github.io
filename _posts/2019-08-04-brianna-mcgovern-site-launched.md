Before I ever wanted a personal website, I wanted to make a food blog made by a college student, for college students. It would include simple and cheap recipes that require minimum ingredients and minimum kitchen tools because sometimes you don't have access to an oven, or a pan, or a bowl -- it happens! However there is one thing us collegiates almost always have: the Internet. With this at our fingertips (or with Siri nearby) we can solve any problem!! 

So, welcome to my food blog -- to hearby be called **Kitchen Hacks for College Hackers**. I hope you enjoy.
