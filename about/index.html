<title> About Me </title>

<p>I am currently attending Santa Clara University, pursuing a BS in Computer Science and Engineering and a MS in Engineering Management and Leadership. <br>I work for the School of Engineering as Engineering Events Assistant. In my role, I regularly plan and execute events for faculty, staff, students, and alumni. <br>I am seeking an software or data science internship. I am experienced in C, C++, Python, HTML/CSS, and Matlab. <br>In my freetime, I am working with Valley Palms Together to redesign <a href="https://www.valleypalmsneighborhood.com">valleypalmsneighorhood.com</a> to better meet the needs of the members of the community. <br> Have a project but need another set of eyes and fingers? <a href="mailto:bmcgovern007@gmail.com">Email me</a>.
